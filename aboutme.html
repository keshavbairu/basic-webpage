  <blockquote>
    <p>I am confident in my abilities to produce and while I prepare for the worst, I do the work necessary to tilt the odds that the best will happen.I will seek to work for a successful company that has strong leadership and vision and who recognizes and rewards performers and modest, but hard working and I consistently sets firm goals for myself.  Then, once I've defined the benchmarks, I take the necessary steps to achieve those milestones,I can  control a situation rather than  a situation control me . someone who has been able to not only meet my employer's expectations, but I would describe myself as a person who has consistently exceeded those markers.I am someone who is mature, candid and who has integrity.  Everyday I work to improve myself and my skills which is part of maturing and becoming better at what I do. </p>
